Documentation 

Title : Focus Timer App

1.Introduction :
The Focus Timer app aims at solving the problem of distracted working and helps increase productivity manifolds.
The app has a symbolic logo.
It opens the introductory page which explains all the rules to the user.
The app then navigates to the next page in which a Study Timer of 45 minute is set.
This timer helps the user to achieve their goal without distractions.
From here the app navigates to the Break Timer  of 15 minutes in which the user can relax.
This Break Timer ensures that the break is not extended beyond the stipulated time and the user can get back to working as soon as the break time is over. 
Thus the app ensures increased productivity and focus and efficient time management which is an extreme necessity in today's world filled with abstract distractions.
